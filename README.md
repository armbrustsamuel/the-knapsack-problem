## The Knapsack problem
The backpack optimization is a classical algorithm problem. You have two things: a backpack with a size (the weight it can hold) and a set of boxes with different weights and different values. The goal is to fill the bag to make it as valuable as possible without exceeding the maximum weight. It is a famous mathematical problem since 1972. The genetic algorithm is well suited to solve that because it’s an optimization problem with a lot of possible solutions.

Other algorithms aren’t efficient at all, see the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karp%27s_21_NP-complete_problems) page if you want to understand why.
